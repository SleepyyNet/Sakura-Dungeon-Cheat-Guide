# Sakura Dungeon Cheat Guide

Sakura Dungeon was made with the visual novel engine [Ren'Py](https://www.renpy.org/).  
It's makes it harder to hack the game with something like Cheat Engine, but it's based on [Python](https://www.python.org/), so the game scrips can be easily decompiled and modified.  
In case of Sakura Dungeon we don't have to decompile anything, the game got an developer console, that can be simple enabled and used to modify the game while playing. This is what the guide about.

Generally the console can execute any valid python command.  
We will use it to manipulate the game.  

### Modify stats and attributes
After starting a new game or loading a save (not in main menu), you can modify your companions(actors) stats and attributes.  
Stats like VP or AP are dynamic and will be reset to max value in special situations.  
Attributes are more static and will be only modified by items you use.
#### Generally
Each ally got an [object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_\(computer_science\)), you can modify anything about him through his object. Normally this objects got the same name as the character, but there are exceptions. See the *full actors list* below for more informations.  

There are two main characters, **Yomi**(the player) and your first companion **Ceri**.  
Yomi is coincident the player himself, so you can access her/players object through `player` or `fox`.  
And Ceri's object is named `knight`.
With this information you can start modify their stats and attributes.  
At fisrt, let us modify our **Mana shards** amount, attribute `currency` hold this information:    
`player.currency=991337` or `fox.currency=991337` (is the same)

All object id's and attributes you can find in the [full actors list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12vLrKiqmfnh0nwrKD5HbC9Qk7lWj77fPff1_-cSj5Os) .

#### Stats
Possible stats are `VP`, `AP` and `CP`.  
Example for Ceri:   
VP: `knight.vp=200`   
AP: `knight.ap=200`  
CP: `knight.cp=200`

#### Attributes
The list of all attributes you can find below in the full actors list.  
Resistance work a bit different, 1 point = 25%.  
Examples for Ceri:  
level: `knight.level=20` (set level to 20)  
Vit (vitality): `knight.vit=100` (set vit to 100)  
fire (resistance): `knight.fire=4` (4 \* 25% = 100%)  
shock (resistance): `knight.shock=2` (2 \* 25% = 50%)  
and so on  

**Attention! Modify attributes like `type`, `skills`, `abilities`, `hit`, `suffer` or `info` only if you know what you are doing!**

### Add or remove companions
**Be careful some actors like Ceri(knight) can't be removed! Always make a save before you add someone!**  

Objects `party` and `backup`. **Get sure that your `party` isn't full before you add someone!**  
You can execute two methods on both objects, `append` and `remove`.  
Example:  
`backup.append(bunny)` will add a bunny to your "BackUp".  
Then you can remove a bunny with  
`backup.remove(bunny)`  
same with `party`.
